### SMOOTH ROD:In a Cartesian 3D printer, the smooth rod is a key component of the printer’s structure. It is part of the printer’s design where one axis moves another, for example, the X-axis rails ‘sit’ on the Y-axis rails

### BEARING:In a Cartesian 3D printer, bearings play a crucial role in the movement of the printer head and the print bed. They are typically used in the printer’s gantry system, where the print bed is fixed and the printhead or extruder moves along two perpendicular axes

### IDLER:In a Cartesian 3D printer, an idler is a critical component of the extruder, which is the part of the printer that feeds the filament into the hot end for melting and deposition

### EXTRUDER:In a Cartesian 3D printer, the extruder is a mechanical device that feeds, melts, and deposits the printing material onto the print bed or previous layers, meticulously building up a three-dimensional object

### MOTOR:In a Cartesian 3D printer, motors are essential components that control the movement of the printer head and the print bed along the X, Y, and Z axes.These motors are typically stepper motors, which move in discrete steps, allowing for precise control over the movement of the printer components. The motors receive instructions from the printer’s control board, translating digital commands into physical movement

### Y-AXIS SUPPORTER: The Y-axis is one of the three primary axes in a Cartesian coordinate system used by 3D printers. In the context of a 3D printer

### HORIZONTAL THREADED ROD:
### Function: In a Cartesian 3D printer, a horizontal threaded rod is often used as part of the mechanism to move components horizontally along a specific axis, usually the X-axis or Y-axis.

### VERTICAL THREADED ROD:
### Function: In a Cartesian 3D printer, a vertical threaded rod is commonly employed for vertical motion, often associated with the Z-axis.

### SMOOTH ROD : Smooth rods are cylindrical rods made of materials such as steel or aluminum with a smooth and polished surface. They are used to guide and support the linear motion of moving components in a 3D printer.

### PULLEY :  A pulley is a wheel with a grooved rim designed to hold and guide a belt or a cable. In a Cartesian 3D printer, pulleys are commonly employed as part of the motion system to facilitate the movement of the print head or the print bed along a specific axis.

### Motor : A motor in a Cartesian 3D printer is an electromechanical device that converts electrical energy into mechanical motion. It serves as the power source for moving components along the X, Y, and Z axes.

### Y-Axis Frame : The Y-axis frame provides the structural support and stability necessary for the components moving along the Y-axis. It holds the linear motion components, such as smooth rods or linear rails, and is designed to withstand the forces and vibrations associated with the printer's operation.

### Y-Axis Base :The Y-axis base serves as the lowermost structural component that supports the entire Y-axis assembly, including the print bed and its motion system. It is responsible for maintaining the stability and rigidity of the Y-axis movements during the 3D printing process.
